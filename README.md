### This notebook shows example usage of the PyTICS algorithm for NGC 3783 taken with ten 1-m telescopes for the u band 
### The main github page has attached the paper on the algorithm (Vieliute et al. submitted to MNRAS)
### PyTICS will soon be available as a public access package allowing for easy intercalibration of photometric data with a couple lines of code as shown below
